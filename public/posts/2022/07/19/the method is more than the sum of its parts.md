Everyone remembers a good teacher. Sometimes, that teacher isn’t even in the room, sometimes, it’s just a voice on the page. For me, that voice was Ken Stroud.

If you’ve studied engineering, chances are you’ve heard of Engineering Mathematics by Ken Stroud. And if you were anything like me, someone who got absolutely fucked by math, it might’ve been your lifeline.

I failed Engineering Math 1 and 2. Not once. Not twice. But four fucking times barring the 5th.

I used to walk into the exam hall with shit in my hands hoping some of it would stick. It didn’t. And to make it worse, PES has a rule in the rulebook: fail a subject five times and you get kicked back to year two. (Turns out that was bullshit, you can get out of it by paying a fee)

By the time my fifth attempt came around, I was hanging on by a thread. That’s when I saw a random Reddit comment mentioning an article realted to Stroud’s. I figured, fuck it, what else do I have to lose?

That decision changed everything.

I went over to the MRD Library, sat my ass down and studied when pretty much everyone else had internships or projects going on (maybe cant put a pin on the timeline)

Stroud didn’t write like the other textbook guys. He didn’t drown you in formulas and hope you float. He actually taught. Step by step. Slowly. Thoughtfully. He broke shit down in a way that felt human. Like he knew where you were going to fuck up, and he met you there.

What I didn’t know then was that Stroud had spent his life thinking deeply about how students actually learn, especially the ones transitioning from school to university, who were suddenly expected to keep up without ever being shown how. He invented something called "programmed learning" back in the 60s, where the syllabus was broken into weekly chunks, each clear, focused, and actually doable. It wasn’t some robotic, test-prep nonsense. It was just good teaching.

And on that 5th try? I didn’t just pass. I got a fucking B (from an F).

Stroud didn’t write his book to make a name. He was trying to fix a broken system, one where students weren’t stupid or lazy, just fucking overwhelmed. He didn’t believe in gatekeeping knowledge. He believed in guiding you through it.

Ken Stroud passed away in Feburary of 2000. Most of us never met him. But thousands of us owe him a quiet, serious thank you. His legacy isn’t just a textbook that’s survived decades. It’s the mindset that learning should be kind, clear, and actually possible, even when everything else is telling you you’re not enough.

I didn’t "get" math, until I did. And that’s because Stroud showed me that with the right approach, even the most stubborn concepts eventually crack.

Sometimes your best teacher isn’t a person. Sometimes your best teacher is a paperback with a beat-up cover and a genius quietly tucked between the pages.
Also, special shoutout to BMS from PES University. You’re a real one.
